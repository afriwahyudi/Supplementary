# Supplementary
Supplementary materials for amine-CO2 neural network model, and few other code to help analysis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although random seed was set, the results might still be different to what we got due to different hardware configuration. The difference mostly dismissable.

For the notebook in 'Notebook_for_LocalMachine' folder
This code were written and run on :
1. Asus ROG GL553VD
2. 16 GB RAM
3. NVIDIA 1050Ti
4. Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2808Mhz 4 Cores
5. 8 Logical Processors
6. Written in Microsoft VSCode
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this notebook, 
1. Download 'Notebook_for_LocalMachine' to your local machine
2. We recommend to use IDE such as Microsoft VSCode to run this
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the notebook in 'Notebook_colabs' folder
can be used in googlecolabs right away.
Just import this notebook in colabs then run
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notebook usage step:
1. Choose the model from '/Model' folder
2. Use the dataset in '/datasetscsv' folder
3. Make sure to use appropriate model for each .ipnyb notebook for analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'/Model_logs' folder consist of training history of each model in our local machine
