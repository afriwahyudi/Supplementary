# Supplementary
Supplementary materials for amine-CO2 neural network model, and few other code to help analysis

1. Choose the model from '/Model' folder
2. Use the dataset in '/datasetscsv' folder
3. Make sure to use appropriate model for each .ipnyb notebook for analysis

Although random seed was set, the results might still be different to what we got due to different hardware configuration

This code were written and run on :
Asus ROG GL553VD
16 GB RAM
NVIDIA 1050Ti
Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2808Mhz 4 Cores
8 Logical Processors
